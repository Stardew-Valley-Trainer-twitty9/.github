## 🎮 What is a Stardew Valley Trainer?

A **trainer** is a standalone program that runs alongside your game and injects real-time memory changes to give you cheat powers. Unlike mods that require SMAPI or save file edits, a trainer is fast, easy, and direct—perfect for players who just wanna flip some switches and *instantly* break the limits.

Trainers are loaded with toggleable options like:

* 💸 Add 1M gold instantly
* 🔋 Infinite stamina + health
* 🕒 Freeze or control time
* 🧺 Auto-harvest crops
* 💬 Max all relationships

You basically unlock full sandbox mode without touching your save files or messing with scripts.
